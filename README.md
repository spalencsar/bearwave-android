# BearWave Android

BearWave is a modern, premium internet radio streaming app for Android, built with Flutter. It features a clean design inspired by the KDE desktop environment, full Android Auto integration, Google Cast support, and dynamic metadata/cover art loading.

This is the mobile port of the desktop Qt6/QML app at https://github.com/spalencsar/bearwave.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK >= 3.38.4
- Dart SDK >= 3.12.1
- Java 17 (JDK 17 OpenJDK)
- Android SDK

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/spalencsar/bearwave-android.git
cd bearwave-android

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on connected device
flutter run
```

### Build APK

```bash
# Debug APK
flutter build apk --debug
# Output: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk

# Release APK
flutter build apk --release
# Output: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

### Android Auto Testing

For real car head units, prefer a release APK. Debug or shell-installed builds can be filtered differently from DHU tests.

```bash
flutter build apk --release
adb install -r -i com.android.vending build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

The Android Auto experience is served by `BearWaveAudioHandler` through `audio_service` / `MediaBrowserService`. It exposes browsable radio categories, search results, MediaSession metadata, a one-item playback queue, and prepare/play callbacks for the Now Playing screen.

### Arch Linux Setup

```bash
# Install Java 17
sudo pacman -S jdk17-openjdk

# Configure Flutter to use Java 17
flutter config --jdk-dir /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk

# Verify setup
flutter doctor
```

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Framework | Flutter (Dart 3.12+) |
| State Management | Provider + ChangeNotifier |
| Audio Playback | just_audio |
| Background Audio | audio_service |
| HTTP Client | http |
| Persistence | SharedPreferences |
| Cast Support | cast_plus |
| Image Caching | cached_network_image |
| API | Radio Browser API |

## Architecture

```
RadioBrowserApi (HTTP) → Providers (State) → Screens/Widgets (UI)
SharedPreferences ← StorageService ← Providers
BearWaveAudioHandler (audio_service + just_audio) → PlayerProvider → PlayerBar / StationCard
CastService (cast_plus) → PlayerProvider / CastDialog
```

## API

BearWave uses the [Radio Browser API](https://api.radio-browser.info/) with DNS-based server selection via `all.api.radio-browser.info`. This automatically routes to the nearest available server.

## Current Status

- `flutter analyze` is expected to report no issues.
- `flutter test` currently contains only a placeholder smoke test.
- Android Auto works through `audio_service`, but real head units should be tested separately from DHU because filtering and callback behavior can differ.
